1.Create a new repository on GitHub: Go to the GitHub website (https://github.com/) and sign in to your account. Click on the "+" icon at the top-right corner of the page and select "New repository" from the dropdown menu. Provide a name for your repository and configure any other desired settings. Click on "Create repository" to create the repository on GitHub.

2. Initialize your local project as a Git repository: Open your project folder in VS Code. In the VS Code terminal, navigate to the root directory of your project (where your code files and .gitignore file are located). Run the following commands to initialize a new Git repository and connect it to your GitHub repository.  Replace <repository-url> with the URL of the repository you created on GitHub. You can find the repository URL on the GitHub website, typically in the "Clone or download" button.

git init
git remote add origin <repository-url>

3. Stage and commit your files: In the VS Code terminal, use the following commands to stage and commit your files:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

4.  This will stage all the files in your project directory and create an initial commit with the message "Initial commit". Feel free to modify the commit message according to your needs.

git push origin master
